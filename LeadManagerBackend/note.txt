# Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

- it is a mechanism that allows a web page to access resources from a different domain.
- It's an extension of the same-origin policy, which restricts access to resources from different domains by default.

=> To allow this in django we need to install django-cors-headers

=> and enable cors in settings.py file with following configurations

1. CORS_ALLOW_ORIGINS = [
    'http://127.0.0.1:5173/',
    'http://127.0.0.1:6700/'
]

2. CORS_ALLOW_ALL_ORIGINS = bool
